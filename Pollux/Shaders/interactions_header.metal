/**
 * Scatter a ray with some probabilities according to the material properties.
 * For example, a diffuse surface scatters in a cosine-weighted hemisphere.
 * A perfect specular surface scatters in the reflected ray direction.
 * In order to apply multiple effects to one surface, probabilistically choose
 * between them.
 *
 * This scatters rays according to their Bidirectional Scattering Distribution
 * Function that is a property of whichever material you intersect.
 *
 * ray:         The ray to be scattered and shaded
 * isect:       Ray-object intersection point. Used to scatter Ray further
 * m:           Intersected object's material
 * rng:         An instance of the Loki rng that creates a new random
 *              number at every thread instance
 * pdf:         The probability that the ray would be scattered in this newly
 *              sampled direction
