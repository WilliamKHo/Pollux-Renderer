/**
 * This file contains the heart of the shading for Pollux.
 * Each BSDF has it's own shading function which handles all
 * shading and scattering (SnS) logic. The code base Pollux
 * is based off of uses this, and we never thought of fixing things.
 *
 * The better way would be to separate shading and scattering logic
 * as you never know when you might need either. Also, more importantly
 * The code structure described in Physically Based Rendering Techniques
 * by Matt Phar, Wenzel Jacob, and Greg Humphreys is a lot more robust
 * A future potential improvement is to adapt that method. For now,
 * this will have to do.
 *
 * Nevertheless, here are the function parameter definitions:
 *
 * - ray:       the incoming ray to scatter and shade
 *
 * - isect:     the ray's intersection point with the object
 *
 * - m:         the intersected object's material properties
 *
 * - rng:       a random number generator passed in by reference
 *              to support multiple calls to .rand()
 *
 * - pdf:       the pdf of the ray after it has been scattered
 *              this is used to balance ray contribution and is
 *              passed in by reference as well as it's filled in
 *              based on the scattering
